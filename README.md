> A Hybrid Key-Value Store for Fast Writes, Efficient Reads, and Seamless Replication

![build](https://github.com/github/docs/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

kvalchemy is a high-performance, replicated key-value store that blends the best of WALs, Memtables, and B-Trees to achieve:

âœ… Blazing-fast writes without LSM compaction overhead.

âœ… Optimized range queries with minimal disk I/O using B-Trees

âœ… Efficient replication via gRPC WAL streaming & B-Tree snapshots

âœ… Seamless multi-region scaling with rapid failover

## Why kvalchemy?

Traditional KV stores force a trade-off:

â€¢	LSM-Trees (e.g., RocksDB) are great for fast writes but suffer from high read amplification & expensive compactions.

â€¢	B+Trees (e.g., BoltDB) provide efficient lookups but struggle with high-speed inserts & replication.

### kvalchemy merges both worlds by:

â€¢	Using Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for durability & replication.

â€¢	Leveraging Memtables (Skiplists) for rapid ingestion.

â€¢	Storing data in B-Trees, enabling efficient queries & instant snapshots.

Architecture

kvalchemy is designed to scale efficiently across distributed environments:

## Storage Engine

![storage architecture](docs/kvalchemy_storage.png)

## Development
```sh
make lint
make test
```

## certificate for Local host

```shell
brew install mkcert

## install local CA
mkcert -install

## Generate gRPC TLS Certificates
## these certificate are valid for hostnames/IPs localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

mkcert -key-file grpc.key -cert-file grpc.crt localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

```
